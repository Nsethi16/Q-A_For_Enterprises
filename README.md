# Intelligent Q&A for Enterprise


## Topic

The topic of this project is "Intelligent Question & Answer (Q&A) Systems for Enterprise." Aim to develop a system that leverages Text retrieval methods and natural language processing (NLP) to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses to user queries based on Enterprise’s own information. 


This Code Repository is built with an example of Azure Cognitive Search Function/Skill for RAG scenario but can easily be extended with other Function/Skill.


## Problem Statement

Traditional information retrieval systems for enterprises often fall short in delivering accurate, context-aware answers to user queries. This leads to increased time spent by employees searching for information, which can hamper productivity and hinder well-informed decision-making. Moreover, enterprise documents often contain domain-specific jargon and industry-specific knowledge, further complicating the process of understanding and responding effectively.
This project will address this problem by providing quick access to information based on Enterprise’s own information.


## Design
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) design pattern will be used for this project. 

## Dataset
A publicly available Text based dataset will be used to build this project.
## Demonstration of working as expected
Evaluation of this system will be done against a set of benchmarks Q&A
## Programming language
Python
## Work Load
This project will be done by a single Team member and will easily take more than 20 Hours as it will require not only writing code for this project but optimization for better performance as well
